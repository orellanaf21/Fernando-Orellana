Project:
- Bookstore: This is a project that I worked on in 1213, where I programmed a bookstore system from scratch which takes user input let's the user select what books it wants to buy. It used a csv file to populate the program with data and also to update the results after the user bought from it. The programming language used was Java for this project.
- Photo App: This is a project that I worked in 3155, along side with a group we developed a fullstack application that allowed the upload of photos and also comments. It also contained a sign in feature. The project was developed using node, javascript, react, and mongodb.

Goals & Objectives:
- Get an understanding on the full life cycle of a software development project.
- Get a better understanding on developing full-stack applications.
- Get a better exposure to testing and deploying code.
